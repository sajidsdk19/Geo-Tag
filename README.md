# GeoT City Replacer

**GeoT City Replacer** is a lightweight WordPress plugin that dynamically replaces the `[geot_city]` token anywhere on your website pages with the visitor's city name, based on their IP address.

It uses the free [ip-api.com](http://ip-api.com) geolocation service and works by scanning your site's final HTML output and replacing the `[geot_city]` token before the page is sent to the visitor.
